## URL Shortener.
### Code Forked from "WebDevSimplified" and Used to my project "Dynamic-Greetings" for shortening the URL for an easy convey of greetings. [Project here.](https://github.com/Abhiramborige/Dynamic-Greetings/)

## API format: 
- GET root/.netlify/functions/server/ - health.
- GET root/.netlify/functions/server/:shortUrl - unique shortID for long URL.
- POST root/.netlify/functions/server/shortUrl - map each long URL to shortID.
